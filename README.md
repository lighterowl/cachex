# spath's Cache Explorer

This is a fork of the Cache Explorer tool, written by spath, a member of the
CDFreaks (now called MyCE) forums. It aims to obtain information about a CD
drive's cache size for audio data and examine if it's possible to disable cached
reads in a particular model.

The original post where the source had been shared was luckily archived by
the Internet Archive [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20160114125735/http://club.myce.com/f61/cache-explorer-184487/index2.html#post2522328)
along with the archive itself. Unfortunately, no licencing information is
available, so for all I know I'm infringing spath's copyright by making
modifications to the software.

There's also a discussion thread in the [Hydrogenaudio forums](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,45996.0.html).

The root commit of this repository represents the source as it appeared in the
originally shared archive.
