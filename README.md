# spath's Cache Explorer

This is a fork of the Cache Explorer tool, written by spath, a member of the
CDFreaks (now called MyCE) forums. It aims to obtain information about a CD
drive's cache size for audio data and examine if it's possible to disable cached
reads in a particular model.

The original thread where the source was shared is
[here](https://club.myce.com/t/cache-explorer/167099/33). Unfortunately, no
licencing information is available, and the link in the forums is long dead. The
root commit of this repository represents the source as presented in the
originally shared archive.
