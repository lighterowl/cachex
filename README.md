# spath's Cache Explorer

This is a mirror of the Cache Explorer tool, written by spath, a member of the
CDFreaks (now called MyCE) forums. It aims to obtain information about a CD
drive's cache size for audio data and examine if it's possible to disable cached
reads in a particular model.

The original thread where the source was shared is

licencing information is available.
